    "phd_student_mentor": "TBD based on project and availability",
    "terms_available": "Fall, Spring, Summer",
    "student_level": "Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, 2-3 students per semester",
    "prerequisites": "Projects can be customized for background and interest of the student, pending lab needs at the time. Helpful skills (encouraged but not required) include: programming fundamentals, experimental design, data analysis, experience working with children, good people skills, attention to detail, organization, time management. High-achieving freshman encouraged to apply! Students considering graduate school strongly encouraged to apply!",
    "credit": "0-3 credits via EGN 4912",
    "stipend": "1st semester, none unless selected for University Scholars; after trial period, $15/hour up to 10 hours per week",
    "application_requirements": "Resume, UF unofficial transcripts, faculty interview; email all application requirements to Lisa Anthony",
    "application_deadline": "applications are accepted on a rolling basis, but first come first served (recommend: Mar 15 or July 1 for Fall, Nov 15 for Spring, Mar 15 for Summer)",
    "website": "http://init.cise.ufl.edu",
    "project_description": "Our lab focuses on advanced interaction technologies such as touch, gesture, voice, and mixed reality, in the context of human-AI interaction, education, healthcare, and serious games. Many of our projects emphasize children and/or families as a unique user group. Our projects advance human-computer interaction (HCI) research questions of how users want to interact with these natural modalities, and computer science research questions of how to build recognition algorithms that can understand user input in these ambiguous modalities. Top priorities currently: (a) designing intelligent chatbots for mobile health monitoring apps; (b) designing digital AI assistants to help novice users complete more expert tasks; and (c) designing human-centered interactive machine learning interfaces."
